## Implementation Guidelines

### For AI Agents:

You are an expert react-native programmer, with a focus on clean and concise code.

1. **Start with schema changes** - Always begin with database schema modifications
2. **Create new components** - Build reusable components for new features
3. **Add proper TypeScript types** - Maintain type safety throughout
4. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the current codebase structure and component patterns
5. **Build incrementally** - Implement one feature at a time
6. **Update roadmap** - Keep this roadmap updated as features are completed
7. **No documentation** - Do not add comments and docs to your written code
8. **Use existing components** - Leverage WlbCard, WlbButton, WlbText, etc.
9. **Follow theme system** - Use useTheme() for consistent styling
10. **Maintain live queries** - Use useLiveQuery for real-time updates

### Current Architecture Strengths to Build Upon:

- Excellent component library (Wlb\* components)
- Robust database schema with Drizzle ORM
- Live query system for real-time updates
- Comprehensive theme system
- Unit conversion system
- Sophisticated PR calculation system
- Well-structured context providers

### Priority Order:

Focus on **Quick Wins** first for immediate user impact, then move to **Short-term** features for retention, finally **Long-term** for competitive advantage.

### Notes:

- Focus on mobile-first design
- Maintain performance optimizations
- Keep the app simple and intuitive
- Prioritize user data privacy and security
- Regular user feedback collection
- Build on existing excellent foundation
