4. Add image cleanup functionality for deleted workouts
5. Update database schema to store persistent image paths

## Implementation Guidelines

### For AI Agents:

You are an expert react-native programmer, with a focus on clean and concise code.

1. **Start with schema changes** - Always begin with database schema modifications
2. **Create new components** - Build reusable components for new features
3. **Add proper TypeScript types** - Maintain type safety throughout
4. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the current codebase structure
5. **Build incrementally** - Implement one feature at a time
6. **Update roadmap** - Keep this roadmap updated as features are completed.
7. **No documentation** - Do not add comments and docs to your written code.

### Priority Order:
